# ISP Portal
ISP Portal is a simple sofware used to by ISPs to manage customer subscriptions - well, at least thats how it started out.

Currently, its used to manage VMs on a Proxmox VE backend.

## Technologies used
ISP Portal is built with Flask. The database backend can be any database that is supported by SQLAlchemy.

Note that this is a simple project used to sharpen my skills on Flask. It is by no means production ready.
